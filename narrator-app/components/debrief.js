            <h3>Study Title: Interpersonal Conflict Narratives Research</h3>
            <h4>Principal Investigator: Dr. Mark Allen Thornton</h4><br/>

            <strong>What was the purpose of this study?</strong>
            <p>
                This study aimed to understand how people talk about interpersonal conflicts, and what type of feedback different categories 
                of interpersonal conflict people expect. During interpersonal conflict storytelling like the one you just narrated, people share 
                information in multiple ways, including tone of voice and of course the verbal content of their speech. This project will analyze 
                these different streams of information, as well as what feedback people desire when they share stories about their interpersonal 
                conflict. Doing so will provide new insight into how people form impressions of people in conflict, seek and deliver feedback, 
                and experience different categories of interpersonal conflict.

            <strong>What were our research goals?</strong>
            <p>
                We were focused on two main research goals. First, we aim to understand how people narrate stories of their interpersonal 
                conflicts. Second, we wish to understand what feedback people desire when sharing their conflict stories. 
            </p>
            <strong>How was this study conducted?</strong>
            <p>
                During the study, you were given a selection of interpersonal conflict topics to choose to record yourself narrating a personal 
                story about. You also shared with us what feedback you would expect if you were sharing this story with someone else. We will use 
                the content of your narratives to aggregate over many other narratives, to determine how a wider population of people narrate their 
                interpersonal conflict stories, and what, on average, people expect to hear from their community members when sharing their stories.  
            </p>
            <strong>Did we tell you everything?</strong>
            <p>
                There was no deception in this study. 
            </p>
            <strong>Why is this study important?</strong>
            <p>
                People seek others out to discuss the interpersonal conflicts in their lives. Whether the goal is to receive feedback about how 
                to navigate the dilemma, or simply share and validate their point of view, the act of divulging information about negative social 
                interactions to others is an essential part of human life. We are using these methods to expand our scientific understanding of 
                how people talk about their interpersonal conflicts, and what type of support the recipients of such stories can provide for the 
                narrators, by way of analyzing the typical feedback that narrators desire.
