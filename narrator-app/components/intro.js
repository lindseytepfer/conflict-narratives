                    <p> 
                        In this experiment, you will record yourself talking about interpersonal
                         conflicts that you have experienced. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        We will present several topics to choose from; out of these categories, you
                        only need to select <strong>four</strong> stories to share to complete the study.  
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        After you finish each recording, you will be asked five follow-up questions about that 
                        specific scenario. For example, we'll ask how recent this conflict is, if you
                        have told anyone about the situation before, and, hypothetically, how you would want a 
                        listener to respond if you were to share your experience.
